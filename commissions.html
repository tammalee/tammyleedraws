            <h1>Commissions</h1>
            <p>I am currently open for commissions. Email <a href="mailto:tammyleedraws@gmail.com">tammyleedraws@gmail.com</a> with your commission details and we'll start a conversation!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-commission-pricing">
            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            
            <p>Commissions are $50 CAD/hr. The more work that goes into a commission the more it costs.</p>
            
            <p>Here are some rough estimates:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Sketch - 1 hour</li>
                <li>Inks - 2 hours</li>
                <li>Coloured - 3-4 hours</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Backgrounds and additional characters can be extra but it really is on a case-by-case basis. So let me know what you're
            thinking you'd like and we can chat.</p>
            
            <p>I work in Procreate which has analytics including how an illustration takes so I have a pretty good idea of
            how long it I need.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-commission-topics">
            <h2>Topics</h2>
            <p>I don't do NSFW or Mecha/mechanical illustrations. (Please don't ask me for your character banging in a corvette that's
            also a Transformer.) OCs are great but if you have a reference pic things will go much more smoothly.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-commission-process">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>If you are okay with the prices above, this is how the process will go.</p>
            <p>I will ask you questions about what it is you're wanting to commission. I'll ask for reference photos, if you have any, and more details.</p>
            <p>I may ask you to point out an illustration of mine that you particularily like to get an idea of the style you'd like me to use.</p>
            <p>Commissions are a collaboration. The more you can tell me about what you want, the closer I'll be able to get to your vision.</p>
            <p>That being said, if we don't vibe or I just don't seem to be able to produce the results you're looking for, we both have the right to part ways amicably without completing the commission.</p>
            <p>Once we agree upon the work to be done, we will settle on a price.</p>
            <p>An illustration usually consists of four stages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sketch</li>
                <li>Ink</li>
                <li>Flat colours</li>
                <li>Shaded colours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One revision is included in your commission and it usually happens in the sketch stage but if you are paying for full colours I'm happy to tweak colours in the flats stage as well. I'm happy to make small tweaks but there is a limit to what is reasonanble.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-commission-payment">
            <h2>Payment</h2>
            <p>Payment in full is required before the final delivery can be completed.</p>
            <p>I have a Paypal account and I can also accept Interac bank transfers within Canada.</p>
            <p>I will send you details depending on which type of payment you prefer.</p>
            <p>I don't usually ask for a deposit, but for a very large or complicated illustration I might.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-commission-delivery">
            <h2>Delivery</h2>
            <p>A low-resolution screenshot of the commission will be sent to you at each stage of the commission for you to review and approve. That means work will not progress until I get the go ahead to start the next stage.</p>
            <p>Once we are both happy with the final product, a Dropbox link will be sent to you where you can download the full resolution artwork file.</p>
            <p>I usually work at 300dpi which makes for a nice print out.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-commission-usage">
            <h2>Commission Use</h2>
            <p>Commissions are not to be used for commercial purposes.</p>
            <p>If you would like to commission me to do commercial work, the pricing structure will be different and we will need to establish a contract.</p>
            <p>Email me at <a href="mailto:tammyleedraws@gmail.com">tammyleedraws@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions about commission usage.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-commission-nextsteps">
            <h2>Next steps</h2>
            <p>If you are intersted in a commission, message me details! I'm happy to chat over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tammyleedraws/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/tammalee">Twitter</a> or you can send me an email at <a href="mailto:tammyleedraws@gmail.com">tammyleedraws@gmail.com</a></p>
